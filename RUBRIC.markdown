# Rubric

Here's how to understand how we'll look at this test and grade your work. This may also help you understand how to prioritize particular work.

There are 5 individual tests:

1. The Index page
2. The iFrame page
3. The Cookie page
4. The Ad page
5. The freeform test question.

The following table shows the weighting of each test and will be used as a testing rubric:

| Test Name     		| Test Weight | Test State | Percent Completed | Final Score |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Active Documentation 	| 10%         |            |                   |             |
| Index         		| 10%         |            |                   |             |
| Iframe        		| 20%         |            |                   |             |
| Cookie        		| 20%         |            |                   |             |
| Ad            		| 35%         |            |                   |             |
| Test Question 		| 5%          |            |                   |             |
|               		|             |            | Total             |             |


Where you cannot finish a test problem we'd prefer to see the level of work you were able to do towards solving the problem and documentation of that work. Partial work will be considered towards the score, and the clearer it is what you were trying to do, the more positively it will be considered.

Possible test states, in order of most to least value:

- Completed with Documentation
- Partially completed with shown work on code and documentation
- Partially completed with documentation
- Partially completed with shown work
- Documented intent to solve but no shown code
- No attempt

Where a task has multiple steps we'll also consider the amount each step is completed as part of the Percent Completed column.
