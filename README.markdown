# Hello Node!

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents a form the visitor can use to submit a color name, sending the submitted value to the back-end API running on the server.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, which has some basic information about this project.

← `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

← `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end, one to return the homepage and one to update with the submitted color. Each one sends data to a Handlebars template which builds these parameter values into the web page the visitor sees.

← `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

← `src/`: This folder holds the site template along with some basic data files.

← `src/pages/index.hbs`: This is the main page template for your site. The template receives parameters from the server script, which it includes in the page HTML.
